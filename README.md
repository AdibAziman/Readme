- 👋 Hi there! My name @AdibAziman and I'm a computer science graduate with a passion for coding and problem-solving.
- 👀 I’m interested in writing massive codes and I love connecting with people from all over the world through my work on GitHub.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning something beyond your expectation. From there, I dove headfirst into the world of software development and never looked back.
- 💞️ I'm constantly pushing myself to learn new technologies and expand my skill set. I'm particularly interested in web development, and I love building beautiful, functional websites that make people's lives easier.
